            Hello! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a second year student at the University of Montana studying theatre technology. In college, I have a special interest in sound for theater, but my main focus is costumes. I first learned how to sew the summer before my senior year of high school just so I could make the costumes for my high school's spring play that year. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since I have been working with the Florence-Carlton Shakespeare Company for three years now, my costuming specialty is Elizabethan clothing. I have researched and made costumes from the Elizabethan era for productions of <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>, and I'm currently working on a production of <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Feel free to take a look at my work experience and contact me with any inquisitions you may have or any requests for commissions if you are interested in my work!
