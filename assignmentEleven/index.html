        This musical by Stephen Sondheim is my favorite musical because the story effortlessly weaves countless classic fairytale characters into one dark, yet hilarious story. Throughout the story, the characters learn the wishes they made "once upon a time" were quite selfish and that to survive the woods, they need each other. They learn that life isn't always a fairytale. But the biggest reason that this musical is my favorite is the expert way that Sondheim crafted a musical motif that links everyone's stories. This motif is called the "bean motif" because it is played when the Baker gives Jack the magic beans. The bean motif can be heard in every other character's unique motif because the magic beans are the main driving force of the story and is in the center and cause of everything to come. I was able to play in the pit orchestra for a production of <i>Into The Woods</i>, so I got to see the instrumental music written out on sheet music, and was able to pick up on these small details that make this musical the masterpiece that it is.
