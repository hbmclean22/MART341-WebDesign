        <i>The Outsiders</i> is a story told from the perspective of a 14-year-old boy named Ponyboy Curtis. The story is set in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1965 and is about the conflict between two rival gangs that are separated by their socioeconomic status. The "greasers" are lower-class and the "Socs," short for "Socials" are upper-class preppy students.
