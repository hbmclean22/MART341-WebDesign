The goal of my website is to serve as an online portfolio for my sewing and costume design work and experience. I want anyone to be able to look at my website and see that I am professional and have experience in multiple fields, whether my audience is any of my theatre professors, curious friends and colleagues, or even future employers. I want it to also be a place to catalog and store all of the projects I have made and to keep it as an on-going list as I continue to create. 

Responsive web design is important because there are now so many different ways we can access websites and the internet, so a website has to be functional for all of them so that all visitors get the experience that they came to the website for. I have gone on many websites on my phone that were completely useless because the scrolling or clicking feature was wrong.
