I would say that my testing sessions went pretty well. The design and layout of my website is relatively simple so there wasn't a whole lot of confusion with the layout. I designed the menu buttons to be pretty visable on purpose. And because it was pretty simple and such an early draft of my website, there wansn't a whole lot to comment on, but it was good to get help with the layout because I was struggling with the best way to lay out the pages when working out the design in the first stages. 

Using the feedback from the testing sessions, I added my job title to the home page. I also tried to move the sections of text around as best as I could for the drafting work page to hopefully make it look better. But my main focus for this draft was to add my photos and captions in because there are a lot of them.
