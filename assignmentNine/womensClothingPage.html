            The first of three types of women's dress in the Elizabethan era was achieved with the <b>Spanish Farthingale</b>. 
            <br/>
            The desired silhouette was an exaggerated small waist, so the skirt was cone-shaped with the hooped Spanish farthingale underneath to make the waist look smaller. The bodice, or torso portion of the dress, was heavily structured as well as worn over structured undergarments. The sleeves were long and fitted to the arms. The entire dress was heavily decorated with embroidery and jewels.

        <p style="float:inline-start">
            The second style of of dress for women came a bit later with the <b>bum roll</b>. 
            <br/>
            The <b>bum roll</b> was a stuffed pad that was tied around the waist. Same with the Spanish farthingale, the purpose of the bum roll was to make the waist look smaller. The skirt was gathered and extended over the bum roll, then fell straight down to the floor.

        <p style="float:inline-start">
            The third style of dress came even later with the reign of Queen Elizabeth I with the <b>French Farthingale</b>. 
            <br/>
            The <b>French Farthingale</b>, or wheel farthingale, or drum farthingale, was a round, structured undergarment secured around the waist. They sometimes had bum rolls worn underneath to help tilt the back of the farthingale up and the front down. Same with the bum roll, the skirt extended out over the farthingale then fell straight down for the floor. The French farthingale was also a more extreme way to make the waist look smaller. The bodice also changed to make the sleeves bigger and more puffy. Extravagant ruffs and tall collars were also introduced. These dresses were also heavily decorated.
