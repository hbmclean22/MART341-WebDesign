            The most basic and common upper garments for men were the <b>doublet</b> and <b>jerkin</b>.
            <br/>
            The <b>doublet</b> was a long sleeved garment that was fitted on the torso and in the sleeves. The stomach portion of the doublet was often padded to achieve the "peascod belly" which was the desired silhouette of the time period for men. 
            <br/>
            The <b>jerkin</b> was a structured garment that was worn over the top of the doublet. It did not have sleeves, but could have had wings, or flanges, that extended over the shoulders and peplums along the bottom of the garment. The jerkin also followed the silhouette for the time.

            At the time, men either wore trousers that gathered below the knee, or the very fashionable <b>trunk hose</b>. 
            <br/>
            <b>Trunk hose</b> were a style of pants that ended around the mid-thigh and were gathered and puffy with stuffing on the inside. They could have panes on them or just be a solid piece of fabric. <b>Canions</b> could be added at the bottom. Canions were an extension of fabric that ended just above the knee and were fitted to the leg.
